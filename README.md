## Chocolate Pizza w/ Aemilius and Pete

1. Pete will create a new repo for the lab with the Alchemy Bootstrap Template
2. We will both cloned down the repo locally
3. We decided to divide and conquer for the inital set up: Pete will add the assets and write up the README and Aemilius will do some initial semantic HTML.
4. We will then pair program, adding in image sources to the html and typing the instructive paragraphs.
5. Next, we'll put together the ingredients text onto the yellow notepad image.
6. Then we'll style everything to look like the preview image, yay!
